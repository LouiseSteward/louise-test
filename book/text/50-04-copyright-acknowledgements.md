## Cover 

The cover image for *Experiencing Economics* was chosen because the rice terracing reflects experimentation as people try to solve problems, including social dilemmas. Just as we look for patterns in the landscape that has resulted, we hope participating in the experiments will encourage students to look for and puzzle over the patterns that result.
