# Print layout

Our layouts are almost entirely automated. That means that the content is marked up for its purpose or role, and the software's algorithms then make the decisions about how it falls on each page. 

It is possible to manually adjust the position or appearance of any given element, but when the text changes later and the pages reflow, those customisations may not work as expected. So we're aiming for a fully automated layout that we're all happy with. This may mean refining the algorithms as we do more chapters, as well as making trade-offs between the efficiency of automation and the page-perfect layouts you'd get from print-centric InDesign-based workflows.
