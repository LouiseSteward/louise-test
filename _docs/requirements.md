# Technical requirements

You can do basic editing of the book online using the [Electric Book Manager](http://manage.electricbook.works).

If you want to produce finished book files on your own machine, you'll need:

* Jekyll 3.2.1 or later (which requires Ruby)
* Prince 11 
* PhantomJS 2.2.1 or later
* Gulp (for converting high-res images in the `print-pdf` folder to the other output formats)
* GraphicsMagick (which our Gulp script requires)
* Pandoc (if you want to do Word output).
